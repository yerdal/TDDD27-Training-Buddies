This project is a web-application for finding training partners, for instance to find someone to play squash with. 
The main function will be to find training partners within the users specifications. Each user has their own profile, which can be created with Facebook.
For example, if someone would like to play squash, he or she can add an advertisement with the desired specifications, such as experience level.
There will also be a text area where the advertiser can write additional information. 
Then, the advertisment will be added to the site, and the other users can search and find it.

The application will be built using MERN.io, which is a full stack tool implementing React, Express, Node and MongoDB.
