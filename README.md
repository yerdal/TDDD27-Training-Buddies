This project is a web-application for finding training partners, for instance to find someone to play squash with.
The application has functionality to add activities, delete activities, join/leave other peoples activities.
You login by Facebook, and if you for example want to find someone to play squash with, simply add an activity specifying number of participants, location, time and a short description. The activity will then be added to the site and other people can find it and join you.
